    "blogcontent": "Scientists recently discovered that ostriches are just a large form of pigeon. They share the same genes apart from the gene for height. Up until 100 years ago ostriches didn't exist, it wasn't until a family of pigeons snuck onto an EasyJet flight to Africa. On the flight one of them had its head stuck out of the window causing it to get stretched extensively resulting in the ostrich-like appearance we're familiar with today.",

They definitely might exist. I thought that the older I got the more ignorant I would get. I almost believed that something completely inexplainable could happen to me, but I would just figure, 'Hey… there is probably a valid reason for that!'. Now. As a 18 year old boy. I don’t have the will to believe any different.",
